abstract={Particle physics has an ambitious and broad experimental programme for the coming decades. This programme requires large investments in detector hardware, either to build new facilities and experiments, or to upgrade existing ones. Similarly, it requires commensurate investment in the R{\&}D of software to acquire, manage, process, and analyse the shear amounts of data to be recorded. In planning for the HL-LHC in particular, it is critical that all of the collaborating stakeholders agree on the software goals and priorities, and that the efforts complement each other. In this spirit, this white paper describes the R{\&}D activities required to prepare for this software upgrade.},

	abstract = {ROOT is a large code base with a complex set of build-time dependencies; there is a significant difference in compilation time between the “core” of ROOT and the full-fledged deployment. We present results on a “delayed build” for internal ROOT packages and external packages. This gives the ability to offer a “lightweight” core of ROOT, later extended by building additional modules to extend the functionality of ROOT. As a part of this work, we have improved the separation of ROOT code into distinct modules and packages with minimal dependencies. This approach gives users better flexibility and the possibility to combine various build features without rebuilding from scratch.

Dependency hell is a common problem found in software and particularly in HEP software ecosystem. We would like to discuss an improvement of artifact management (“lazy-install”) system as a solution to the “dependency hell” problem.

HEP software stack usually consists of multiple sub-projects with dependencies. The development model is often distributed, independent and non-coherent among the sub-projects. We believe that software should be designed to take advantage of other software components that are already available, or have already been designed and implemented for use elsewhere rather than “reinventing the wheel”.

The main idea is to build the ROOT project and all of its dependencies recursively and incrementally, making it fundamentally different than just adding one external project and rebuilding from scratch. In addition, this allows to keep a list of dependencies to be able to resolve possible incompatibility of transitive dependencies caused by the versions conict.

In our contribution, we will present our approach to artifact management system of ROOT together with a set of examples and use cases.}

title = {{Declarative Programming in Escher}},
year = {1995},
publisher = {University of Bristol},
address = {GBR},
abstract = {Escher is a declarative, general-purpose programming language which integrates the
best features of both functional and logic programming languages. It has types and
modules, higher-order and meta-programming facilities, and declarative input/output.
Escher also has a collection of system modules, providing numerous operations on standard
data types such as integers, lists, characters, strings, sets, and programs. The main
design aim is to combine in a practical and comprehensive way the best ideas of existing
functional and logic languages, such as Godel, Haskell, and $lambda$Prolog. Indeed,
Escher goes well beyond Godel in its ability to allow function definitions, its higher-order
facilities, its improved handling of sets, and its declarative input/output. Escher
also goes well beyond Haskell in its ability to run partly-instantiated predicate
calls, a familiar feature of logic programming languages which provides a form of
non-determinism, and its more flexible handling of equality. The language also has
a clean semantics, its underlying logic being (an extension of) Church''s simple theory
of types. This report is divided into two parts. The first part provides a tutorial
introduction to Escher. In this part there are many example programs to illustrate
the various language features. In particular, these example programs are meant to
emphasize the significant practical advantages that come from integrating the best
features of existing functional and logic languages. The second part contains a formal
definition of the Escher language, including its syntax, semantics, and a description
of its system modules. To make the report self-contained, an appendix summarizes the
key aspects of the simple theory of types.}

Like its predecessor Cint, Cling realizes the read-print-evaluate-loop concept, in order to leverage rapid application development. Implemented as a small extension to LLVM and Clang, the interpreter reuses their strengths such as the praised concise and expressive compiler diagnostics. We show how to match the interpreter concept to the compiler library and generalize common set of requirements for building up an interactive interpreter. We reason the design and implementation decisions as solution to the challenge of implementing interpreter behaviour as an extension of the compiler library. We present the new features, e.g. how C++11 will come to Cling and how Cint-specific extensions are being adopted. We clarify the state of integration in the ROOT framework and the induced change set. We explain how ROOT dictionaries are simplified due to the new interpreter.}
